# Pollution-STGCN

This repository contains the code for Pollution STGCN in a upcoming paper on multi-variate air pollution prediction. It uses and improves code from my TF2 updated [repository](https://github.com/Swadesh13/STGCN-Tf2), which is built upon the original TF1 codebase [repo](https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18).
